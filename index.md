### A brief introduction before you get started solving your cube.

Before solving any cube you first need to get familliar with how it moves, and what happens if you move this or that side, since some ways of solving a cube are purely intuitive. However not all the steps to solving a cube are intuitive, and for those you will need algorithms. This website will provide you with most (if not all) information you need to know.

### Step 1

In this step we are going to want to make a white cross. This step is purely intuitive, but an important thing to notice is that the centers are matched up with the edges. You need to keep that in mind, because if they aren't then the cube isn't gonna get solved, unless you use the algorithms that will be mentioned later.
