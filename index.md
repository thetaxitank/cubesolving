### A brief introduction before you get started solving your cube.

Before solving any cube you first need to get familliar with how it moves, and what happens if you move this or that side, since some ways of solving a cube are purely intuitive. However not all the steps to solving a cube are intuitive, and for those you will need algorithms. This website will provide you with most (if not all) information you need to know.
